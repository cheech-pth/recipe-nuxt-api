Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","localizedName":"water","image":"water.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","localizedName":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls.

Heat the mixture until steaming and it begins to foam.  Remove from the heat.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale yellow.  Gradually whisk in one cup of the warm cream mixture, whisking constantly.  Pour the yolks and cream mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly being sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan.  Continue cooking until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.\nPlace some ice and water into a large bowl and place a smaller bowl inside. Pour the cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the bowl.  Stir in the pumpkin and vanilla, add the cinnamon stick back to the mixture. Chill thoroughly, preferably overnight.\nPour the mixture into the freezer can of an electric ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter untill soft.  Add the sugar and continue beating until smooth and creamy.  Stop the mixer occassionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the vanilla, molasses and egg, combine thoroughly.  Mix in the dry ingredients gradually until the dough is smooth.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half until its about 2 inches around, like a log.  Wrap each log in plastic wrap and then roll them lightly to smooth them out.  Refrigerate or freeze until firm.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment.\nSlice the dough into 1/4 inch rounds with a serrated knift being careful to keep their shape. Place the rounds on the baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated or course sugar.\nBake for 10-13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time.  Let the cookies cool in the pan for about 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack.\nDough can be refrigertaed for up to five days or frozen for up to three months.  Baked cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for approximately a week.\nTo assemble the sandwiches:\n(Im sure this is a no-brainer, but.you never know.)\nThaw the ice cream until soft enough to scoop.  Because of the high water content from the pumpkin puree it tends to freeze very firmly.\nTake one scoop of ice cream and place on top of one gingersnap, using a second cookie place on top of the ice cream and gently press down.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, cream, granulated sugar, ginger, ground cinnamon, cinnamon stick, nutmeg and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":10719335,"name":"granulated sugar","localizedName":"granulated sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":1012010,"name":"ground cinnamon","localizedName":"ground cinnamon","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":1002010,"name":"cinnamon stick","localizedName":"cinnamon stick","image":"cinnamon.jpg"},{"id":11216,"name":"ginger","localizedName":"ginger","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":2025,"name":"nutmeg","localizedName":"nutmeg","image":"ground-nutmeg.jpg"},{"id":1053,"name":"cream","localizedName":"cream","image":"fluid-cream.jpg"},{"id":1077,"name":"milk","localizedName":"milk","image":"milk.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404669,"name":"sauce pan","localizedName":"sauce pan","image":"sauce-pan.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Heat the mixture until steaming and it begins to foam.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":3,"step":"Remove from the heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale yellow.

Chop the water chestnuts to small pieces. Add the chopped water chestnuts to the pork mixture. If preferred, use spinach or cabbage in place of water chestnuts.\nAdd 2 to 3 tablespoons of finely chopped scallions or spring onions to the pork mixture. Combine all the filling ingredients well.\nThaw the dumpling wrappers if they are frozen. Keep them well covered until they are ready to be used.\nDust a dish generously with flour. This will hold the dumplings once they are made.\nDust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling.\nPrepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper.\nBring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet. Gently push the filling into the wrapper and pinch the top tip of the dumpling wrapper to seal it.\nFrom the centre of the dumpling, fold a pleat on ONE side and bring it to the other side of the dumpling. Fold towards the centre of the dumpling. Pinch to seal it.\nRepeat and create a 2nd pleat. Be mindful to pinch tight to seal the dumpling well. Repeat and create a 3rd pleat. Each side should have 3 pleats.\nRepeat the same pleating on the other end of the dumpling. Always ensure that the pleats face the centre of the dumpling.\nPlace all prepared dumplings in a well floured dish ensuring that they do not touch each other. Set aside till ready to cook. They can also be frozen at this stage.\nTo cook the potstickers, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan. The potstickers should be cooked in at least 2 batches.\nWhen the oil is hot, add the dumplings ensuring that the flat surfaces face down. Pan fry till the bottoms of the dumplings are a nice golden brown.\nAdd 1/3 cup of water to the pan. Cover the pan immediately and let the steam cook the dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes.\nOnce the water has evaporated, remove the cover and let the dumplings sit in the hot pan for another minute for its base to crisp up again. These are now Chinese potstickers.\nGently transfer the potstickers to a plate. Serve immediately.\nThese Chinese potstickers are best served with a vinegar dip made with balsamic or black chinese vinegar and thinly sliced ginger. Soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil may also be added to the dipping sauce.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Place 200g of ground pork in a large mixing bowl.
